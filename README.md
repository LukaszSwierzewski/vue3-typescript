# vue3-typescript about 

Live demo: https://melodious-kleicha-2522d0.netlify.app/
I decided to build this project using vue3 with composition API and typescript support. For state management I chose Pinia because I want to try something new. The project is hosted on Netlify which makes it very easy to implement CI/CD. Enjoy :)
